Keith Harrigian is a first-year PhD Student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. With his advisor [<span style="color:blue">Mark Dredze</span>](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/), Keith researches computational and statistical methods for modeling natural language. He is particularly interested in developing interpretable forms of machine learning to aid in clinical decision making for mental health. Prior to joining Johns Hopkins, Keith was a Senior Quantitative Analyst at [<span style="color:blue">Warner Media</span>](https://www.warnermediagroup.com) where he leveraged machine learning and natural language processing to mine social media data for applications to film and television marketing. He holds a B.S. in Mathematics with minors in Physics and Music from Northeastern University.
