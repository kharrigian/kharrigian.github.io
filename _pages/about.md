**November 2023** - New paper alert: "An Eye on Clinical BERT: Investigating Language Model Generalization for Diabetic Eye Disease Phenotyping" will be presented at [<span style="color:blue">ML4H</span>](https://ml4health.github.io/2023/) in New Orleans next month. Our study tempers recent claims that language models pretrained on clinical data are necessary for clinical NLP tasks and highlights the importance of not treating clinical language data as a single homogeneous domain.

**July 2023** - New paper alert: "Characterization of Stigmatizing Language in Medical Records" has been accepted to appear in the main proceedings of ACL 2023. We examine what makes harmful language in clinical documentation different from other forms of abusive language in more widely-studied domains. Paper can be found [<span style="color:blue">here</span>](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-short.28/).
