Keith Harrigian is a PhD Student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. With his advisor [<span style="color:blue">Mark Dredze</span>](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/), Keith researches computational and statistical methods for modeling natural language. He is particularly interested in developing interpretable forms of machine learning to aid in clinical decision making and public health research. Prior to joining Johns Hopkins, Keith was a Senior Quantitative Analyst at [<span style="color:blue">Warner Media</span>](https://www.warnermediagroup.com) where he leveraged machine learning and natural language processing to mine social media data for applications to film and television marketing. He holds a M.S.E in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University and a B.S. in Mathematics with minors in Physics and Music from Northeastern University. You can learn more about his past and ongoing work [<span style="color:blue">here</span>](kharrigian.github.io/publications/).

Outside of his academic research, Keith leads data science and machine learning efforts at [<span style="color:blue">Unforged</span>](https://www.kidzabout.net). If you're interested in contributing to the future of digital mental wellness for teenagers and adolescents, please reach out. We're actively looking for passionate developers and data scientists!

## Research Alerts

**3/30/2022** - New paper alert: Our paper "The Problem of Semantic Shift in Longitudinal Monitoring of Social Media" has been accepted to the [<span style="color:blue">14th ACM Web Science Conference</span>](https://websci22.webscience.org). A preprint of the paper is available [<span style="color:blue">here</span>](https://kharrigian.github.io/files/SemanticShift_WebSci2022.pdf).

**6/11/2021** - New paper alert: We presented two papers at CLPsych detailing some of the issues with social media data for mental health. Check out our insights regarding fairness of machine learning classifiers as a function of self-reported gender [<span style="color:blue">here</span>](https://aclanthology.org/2021.clpsych-1.23/) and insights regarding data access/representation [<span style="color:blue">here</span>](https://aclanthology.org/2021.clpsych-1.2/).

**4/21/2021** - New paper alert: "Gender and Racial Fairness in Depression Research using Social Media" will be included in *Proceedings of the 16th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics*. [[<span style="color:blue">Paper</span>]](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.eacl-main.256/)

**4/2/2020** - To support ongoing research efforts related to understanding the spread of information about COVID-19, I have independently reproduced code, data, and models from "Geocoding without geotags: a text-based approach for reddit". Learn more at the Github repository [<span style="color:blue">here</span>](https://github.com/kharrigian/smgeo).

**8/29/2019** - I have officially started my pursuit of a PhD at Johns Hopkins. Reach out if you're ever in Baltimore!

**6/7/2019** - After 2 owners, 3 years, and 4 positions, today marked my last day with Warner Media Applied Analytics. I will forever be thankful for the opportunities that were made available to me by my wonderful colleagues during that time. I now look forward to taking on new challenges as a Computer Science PhD student at Johns Hopkins University. Starting in August, I will be working alongside the Center for Language and Speech Processing and the Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare to create new clinical decision support tools.

**2/12/2019** - I've been promoted to Senior Quantitative Analyst. Grateful for the support that my co-workers have provided to get me to this point.

**11/1/2018** - I'll be attending EMNLP in Brussels, Belgium to present the first-ever approach for geolocating Reddit users. Long-paper can be found [<span style="color:blue">here</span>](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W18-6103). I'll be giving one of the extended talks within the Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text.

**6/15/2018** - My team was acquired by Warner Media (previously Time Warner). Excited for the new data that is about to come my way!

**6/1/2018** - I'll be attending NAACL in New Orleans, LA. Look forward to seeing all the interesting papers in the main conference, in addition to CLPsych and PEOPLES.

**6/5/2017** - I've started a new position as a Quantitative Analyst at Legendary Entertainment. Appreciate the opportunity to return to my previous co-op employer as a full-time team member.

**5/5/2017** - I graduated from Northeastern University (summa cum laude) with a BS in Mathematics. Time to travel a bit before starting a new research position in industry.

**3/25/2017** - I presented work from the Action Lab's "Pitchers and Pianists" at the New England Sequencing and Timing Meeting alongside my collaborators Dena Guo and Professor Dagmar Sternad. Video from the talk can be found [<span style="color:blue">here</span>](https://youtu.be/SDYJOTkm6nA?t=10311). Our talk starts at 2:51:51.

**4/7/2016** - I won the award for Outstanding Student Research in Computer and Information Sciences at the Northeastern University RISE conference for my work to infer the gender of Reddit users using language. Poster can be found [<span style="color:blue">here</span>](https://www.northeastern.edu/rise/presentations/when-anonymity-is-not-anonymous-gender-inference-on-reddit/).
