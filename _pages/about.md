Welcome to my site! I typically try to post major research and life milestones on here. If you are looking for code from one of my projects, please feel free to reach out using my email on the sidebar. While most of my code is proprietary, I may be able to provide guidance or snippets on an individual basis. If you're in the greater Boston area, I'd be glad to meet up in person!

## About Me

Below are some facts about me. I'll leave it up to you to decide whether they're actually interesting :)

* Born in Chicago, IL and raised in Los Angeles, CA.
* Earned a BS in Mathematics from Northeastern University in Boston, MA.
* Currently a Quantitative Analyst at Warner Media Applied Analytics, serving HBO, Turner Broadcasting, and Warner Bros.
* Self-taught computer scientist, with current research focusing primarily on natural language processing, multi-modal machine learning, and anomaly detection.
* Fostered over 40 rescue Golden Retrievers before moving away to college. Cannot wait to adopt one of my own.
* My favorite hobby is model railroading. You can find out more about my layout [<span style="color:blue">here</span>](https://kharrigian.github.io/hobbies/)
